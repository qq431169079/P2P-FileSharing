Running Server1:

Compilation:
gcc -pthread -o server1 server1.c
Run
./server1

It takes as input the port for the server to run on.Range of Port Numbers (1024 , 65535)
If -1 is input , it takes the default port number 23456



Running Server2:

Compilation:
gcc -pthread -o server2 server2.c
Run
./server2

It takes as input the port for the server to run on.Range of Port Numbers (1024 , 65535)
If -1 is input , it takes the default port number 12345

Running Client:

Compilation:
gcc -o client client.c
Run
./client

It takes as input the IP for server 1 . Input 127.0.0.1 for local machine.
It then takes the port number for the machine.This port number has to match the port number of server1 else connection will fail.Use -1 to use default port number(if default is used for server).

It takes as input the IP for server 2 . Input 127.0.0.1 for local machine.
It then takes the port number for the machine.This port number has to match the port number of server2 else connection will fail.Use -1 to use default port number(if default is used for server).

The files for server1 are stored in server1_files
The files for server2 are stored in server2_files
the client files are recieved in client_files.


Large files may not be transferred properly (in some cases) due to fragmentation and poor connection.

For large files with different encoding , for eg pdf , mp4, pptx etc are easily transferred and rendered if running on the same machine , however if server is running on different machine , file is transferred with full size but fails to render sometimes.Text files in any case are easily transferred and rendered.
